### **Introduction - Variables, Vectors, Matrices and Data Loading**

R users have been creating libraries for years - there are literally thousands of libraries that contain packages of functions to make life easier for you as you code in R. I recommend you search Google for "top ten R libraries" to see what most people are using.

[R Studio Package Cheat Sheets](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/)

The process is quite simple - click on ***Tools \> Install Packages*** to install the packages you will need. This process only has to be done once. When you being writing R Scripts or R Markdown files, you will need to load libraries at the beginning for each file you create. You do so by writing:

\> library(package_name)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# Load the necessary libraries at the beginning of your Markdown file
library(tidyverse)
```

### **SHORTCUTS**

A few basic keyboard shortcuts to make life simpler in R:

```{r Shortcuts}

# To insert the "<-" symbol use alt + "-" (alt+minus)
# To insert the pipe operator %>% use Ctrl + Shift + M
# To insert a new code chunk in R Markdown use Ctrl + Alt + I
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **COMMENTS**

```{r Comments}

# Use the hash tag symbol before a string of text to create comments. Comments help people understand your code.
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **BASIC MATH**

R can perform basic math calculations

```{r Math}

2+2
1/6
2^5
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **VARIABLES**

To assign a value to a variable use: \<- (keyboard shortcut: alt + "-")

Your variable will be visible in the Environment Tab (upper right) and can be recalled any time you need it.

```{r Variables}


a <- 2
b <- "Apples"
class(a)
class(b)

# You can perform math on numeric variables:
a*2
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **VECTORS**

The most basic data structure in R. In the previous example, "a" is a vector of length 1. We use the "c" or combine function to create a vector.

```{r Vectors}

vector1 <- c(1,2,4,-7,9,-12,6,-3, 2, 5, 16)
# a numeric vector

vector2 <- c("apples", "oranges", "pears")
# a character vector

vector3 <- c(1,4,"apples", 5)
# vectors can only contain one data type. R will force (coerce) the numbers to strings to create a vector of only one data type.

vector1
vector2
vector3
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **SUBSETTING VECTORS**

Using square brackets [] we can access items from a vector based on their position. Unlike other languages, R starts at position 1 (not position 0)

```{r Subsetting Vectors}

vector1[2]    # choosing a single item
vector1[2:4]  # choosing a range of items
vector2[1]

# If you choose a position outside the length of the vector you will get "NA" as a response

vector3[10]


# We can modify vector contents by using subsetting:
vector2[3] <- "bananas"
vector2

# Or by using an ifelse function (this returns vector1 and replaces all negative values with 0)
ifelse(vector1 < 0, 0, vector1)

# We can select vector items using logcal operators
vector1[vector1<0]

# Performing math on a vector
vector1 + 4
mean(vector1)
median(vector1)
sum(vector1)

vector1 > 0
# returns logical TRUE/FALSE values 
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **MATRICES**

A matrix is a rectangular array of values (of any type) arranged in rows and columns.

```{r Matrices}
# This uses the matrix function to create a matrix with all values in a single column
a.matrix <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6))

a.matrix

# This uses the matrix function to create a matrix with values in two columns
a.matrix <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6), ncol=2)

a.matrix

# we could also use the cbind function to combine two vectors to achieve the same result
a2.matrix <- cbind(c(1,2,3), c(4,5,6))
a2.matrix

# Use the rbind function to combine the vectors in the transpose (rows and columns switched)
a3.matrix <- rbind(c(1,2,3),c(4,5,6))
a3.matrix
```

To perform math on a matrix use functions such as rowSums(), colSums(), rowMeans(), and colMeans()

```{r Matrix Math}
a2.matrix

colSums(a2.matrix)

rowMeans(a2.matrix)
```

To index the element of a matrix you subscript by specifying the row \# and column \# (in that order)

```{r Matrix Subsetting}
a2.matrix[2,1]

# if you leave one of the spaces empty R will assume you want the whole row or column
a2.matrix[,2]
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **FUNCTIONS**

Quite often R users will create their own functions to simplify life when they can't find one. You can create your own functions in R using the following structure:

***function.name \<- function(argument1, argument2, ...)***

***{***

***some functionality***

***}***

when you want to use (or call )the function you simply types its name and provide the necessary inputs

\> function.name(argument1,argument2)

```{r Functions}

# example 1 - a function that adds two numbers together (this already exists, its called the SUM function)

add.numbers <- function(num1, num2)
{
  new_num = num1+num2
  new_num
}

add.numbers(3,6)

# example 2 - a function that checks whether a number is odd or even. returns TRUE if it is even, FALSE if it is odd 

is.even <- function(a.number)
  {
  remainder <- a.number %% 2
  if (remainder==0)
    return(TRUE)
  return(FALSE)
}

# testing
is.even(10)
is.even(7)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **DATA LOADING IN R**

The DPLYR package (part of TIDYVERSE) provides us with access to functions for loading various data types into a dataframe.

There are many ways to import a file into R Studio. First you can use the "Import Dataset" button on the top right:

![](images/Screenshot%202023-10-06%20095743.png)

Alternatively you can use commands such as "read.table" and "read.csv" to import your data directly to a dataframe. It is important to know your working directory when importing files by using code. Use the ***getwd()*** function to see your current working directory.

In your console at the bottom type getwd() and see what it returns

to change your working directory you can use the ***setwd()*** function as follows:

\> setwd("path to working directory")

![](images/Screenshot%202023-10-06%20100340.png)

```{r Data Loading}

# data1 <- read.table("filename.txt", sep = ",", header=TRUE)
# data2 <- read.csv("filename.csv")

# if you get an error message that your file cannot be found, specify the entire file path in between the quotations or alternatively write your code like this:

# data1 <- read.table(file.choose(), sep = ",", header=TRUE)

# We can see the names R has assigned to the columns of the data frame using the names() function. Eg: names(data1)

# We can get the basic structure of the data frame using the str() function. Eg: str(data1)

```

Example:

create a txt file with the following data, and save it to your working directory:

flavour,number

pistachio,6

vanilla,12

chocolate,8

strawberry,14

mint chocolate chip,3

rocky road,9

caramel fudge swirl,5

```{r Data Loading Example}

# Use the data above to create a .txt (in notepad, word)

# The basic structure of the read.table function is:
# dataframe_name <- read.table("paste your file path here in quotes/flavour.txt", sep=",", header=TRUE)

flav <- read.table("C://Users/jason/OneDrive/SAIT/SAIT Instructor/COURSE - NEW_SAIT_DATA420/data/flavour.txt", sep=",", header=TRUE)

# If you are having difficulty getting the file path right, you can use the 
# file.choose() function to search for the file manually  
 
# if you are reading a csv file into your dataframe, you can use the read.csv function
# flav <-  read.csv(file.choose())

# display the first 5 rows of flav
head(flav, 5)

# We can see details of our newly created dataframe in several ways.

# Look for the dataframe in the Environment window on the top right of R Studio
# use a variety of functions to show the properties of the dataframe

# list the structure of the dataframe
str(flav)

# list the columns of the dataframe
names(flav)

# displays the numbers of rows and columns in the dataframe
dim(flav)

# A combination of all of the above
glimpse(flav)

# Opens a new window showing the entire table
#view(flav)


# We can use the $ (extract operator) to access individual columns within a data frame (or use the [[ ]] double square brackets to get the same result)
class(flav$flavour)
```

Note - R sometimes labels string variables as "Factor" (ie nominal or categorical) and not "Character"

R, by default, automatically interprets a column from the data read from disk as a type factor if it contains characters. We can prevent this behavior manually by adding the `stringsAsFactors` optional keyword argument to the `read.*` commands:

```{r Strings As Factors}
# data3 <- read.csv("filename.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

We're now ready to move on to Part 2 where we learn about Data Wrangling and basic plotting using the GGPLOT package.
