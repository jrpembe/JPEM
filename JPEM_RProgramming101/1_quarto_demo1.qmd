## Quarto Demonstration

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r Load Libraries, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r Star Wars Visualization, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#| echo: true
#| label: fig-starwars
#| fig.cap: "Relationship Between Height and Mass of Star Wars Characters"

starwars %>% 
  filter(mass < 100) %>% 
  drop_na(gender) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(mass, height)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.5,
             aes(colour = gender)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(
    title = "Height vs Mass of Star Wars Characters",
    x = "mass (kg)",
    y = "height (cm)",
    colour = "Gender"
  )
  
```

## Including Code in Text:

The average height of Star Wars characters is `r round(mean(starwars$height, na.rm = TRUE)/100, 2)` meters.\
The average mass of Star Wars characters is `r round(mean(starwars$mass, na.rm = TRUE), 2)` kg.

```{r Star Wars Visualization 2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#| echo: true
#| label: fig-starwars2
#| fig.cap: "Density Plot of Height for Humans and Droids"

starwars %>%
  filter(species %in% c("Human", "Droid")) %>%
  drop_na(height) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = height, fill = species)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(
    title = "Density Plot of Height for Humans and Droids",
    x = "Height (cm)",
    y = "Density",
    fill = "Species"
  )
  
```
