Working with gapminder data, we might want to separate "year" into decades or centuries
```{r}
# separate year into century and year
gapminder1 <- gapminder %>% 
  separate(col = year,
           into = c("century", "year"),
           sep = 2)

  

# combine century and year into date
gapminder1 %>% 
  unite(col = date,
        century, year,
        sep = "")

```
