## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

This is some other text that will be "paused" by setting format to "incremental", and will only advance upon page down or button click. Wow

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)

mtcars %>% 
  ggplot(aes(wt, mpg, colour=cyl)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = F) +
  labs(
    title = "Vehicle Mileage vs Weight",
    x = "Weight",
    y = "Miles per Gallon"
  ) +
  theme_bw()
```
